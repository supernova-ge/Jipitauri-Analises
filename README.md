## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this data analysis module is to evaluate the accuracy of Google Translate in translating Georgian to English and vice versa. By analyzing the translations, the main goals are to identify potential errors, weaknesses, and limitations of the tool. Ongoing research and development in this field could lead to improvements in machine translation technology, as well as increased awareness among users about the limitations of automatic translation tools.

### Methods Used

## Project Description
Jipitauri is a project that utilizes machine translation technology to develop a Georgian chatbot powered by GPT-3. The chatbot works by taking user input in Georgian, translating it to English using Google Translate's API, using GPT-3 to generate a response in English, and then translating the response back to Georgian to provide an answer to the user's question. The project collects data from these conversations. By analyzing this data, we aims to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the chatbot, identify potential weaknesses and limitations, and improve machine translation technology for the Georgian language.
